***definitions***

- :PersonalizationFile: is a file that stores :NaturalLanguageInput: for the :App:.

***technical specs***

- :PersonalizationFile: should be called ".personalization.json" and should be stored in ~/.cache/cmd_k/personalization.json.
  - If :PersonalizationFile: does not exist, it should be created.

***functional specs***

- :App: should have a "personalize" <:NaturalLanguageInput:> command that stores :NaturalLanguageInput: in a file.
  - Every "personalize" <:NaturalLanguageInput:> call should add :NaturalLanguageInput: to :PersonalizationFile:.
  - Every call to "plan" and "run" should read :PersonalizationFile: and attach the contents of :PersonalizationFile: to the input prompt to the :Claude: API.
